With rapid urbanization and a fast paced life, some diseases have started appearing in the gastroenterology domain including obesity, gastroesophageal reflux diseases, and cirrhosis. Amongst the cancers, those affecting the stomach and intestines rank third in terms of incidence.

                        <p className="text-left mt-4">Prashanth Super Specialty Hospital, the best gastro hospital in Chennai, provides a comprehensive range of consultative and diagnostic procedures in gastroenterology. The Gastroenterology specialists at the top gastro hospital in Chennai at Prashanth Hospitals are pioneers in advanced minimally invasive diagnostic and surgical procedures. Minimally invasive surgery requires dramatically different skills than those required for traditional surgery. Unlike open surgery, laparoscopic surgeons watch the movements of the surgical instruments through a television monitor. As a result, extensive experience with the manipulation of laparoscopic equipment and the familiarity of performing a detailed procedure while viewing a monitor is required.</p>
                        <p className="text-left mt-4">Many surgical procedures that once required large incisions and long hospital stays are now performed through minimally invasive techniques that require only small incisions.</p>
